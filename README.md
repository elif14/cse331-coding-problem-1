Please add commit version number as you commit and push.
For example, if the last commit is 0.0.1, then you should use 0.0.2. If the last commit was 0.0.10, then it should be 0.0.11.
We will up the 2nd digit as we all agree we completed one of core part of the project.
So if we completed let's say BFS algorithm, then we will up the second digit by 1, 0.0.11 -> 0.1.0
